# Game improvement ideas

## Balance

* Always spawn at least x worms per boat when player is about to starve
* Make hitbox for fish slightly shrink vertically when boosting
    * Could add a new animation for this to make it line up right.
* Make player invincible for 1 frame after boosting but allow for another boost
    * Make this bufferable
    * Add visual indicator of invincibility.
